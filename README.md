# Profiles

Profiles are used to map different beans to different profiles. They are a way to segregate parts of your application configuration to make it only available in certain environments.

For the purpose of our application, we have created two environments, test and prod

In the test environment, we have create an in-memory database as for the production environment, we have created a persistent database.
